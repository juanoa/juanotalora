## Most Prideful Builds

## Some personal stuff

Some basics:

- I was born on **May 25, 1999**, in **Alicante** (Spain), but I moved to Murcia a few years later.
- From a young age, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in engineering, specifically in **computer science**.
- After studying Computer Science, I was accepted into Inditex's young talent program and moved to A Coruña (Galicia, Spain), **one of the places where I've felt most at home**.
- Moving to A Coruña taught me that **stepping out of my comfort zone** is scary, but the results are worth it.
- For the past few years, I've become very active. I climb, run, and surfing.
- Since I started surfing, **the ocean** has become my favorite place in the world.
- One year ago, I bought a **piano**, and since then, I've enjoyed music even more.
- I like setting new challenges and goals for myself from time to time to keep growing both personally and professionally.
- Sometimes I find it hard to believe the achievements I've accomplished, but I think that's better than having an oversized ego.
- I'm addicted to **Notion**; I manage my entire life from there.

Some projects:

- While I was in university, I **co-founded a reusable water bottle brand** with two classmates. We handled everything: purchasing, logistics, website, shipping, marketing, and more. It was an incredible experience.
- I used to **write about frontend best practices** on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@juanoa) blog
