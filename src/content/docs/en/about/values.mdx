title: My values
description: The fundamental principles that guide my decisions and shape my work in software engineering.

## What motivates me

- **Product is key**. I need to believe in the product I'm building and how it can positively impact society.
- A **multidisciplinary** environment where, despite everyone having their own strengths, we can share our opinions in different areas like design or business.
- I value when the engineering team can **interact with users and business** without intermediaries.
- I love **starting projects from scratch**, applying the Pareto principle to quickly achieve 80% of results with 20% of effort.

## What disappoints me

- Hierarchies and **unnecessary bureaucracy**. It overwhelms me.
- Over-engineering, spending more time on implementation than solving the actual problem, and **teams that prioritize technical solutions over functional ones**.

## Strengths

- I excel at **understanding the business and its main pain points**, translating them into solutions that address real problems.
- I'm good at **translating business language into code**, making it more maintainable and scalable. *If someone from business understood programming, they should be able to understand our code*.

## Areas for improvement

- Due to my multidisciplinary approach, I haven't dedicated 100% of my time to being the best technically. Instead, I've also chosen to focus on areas like design, product, complex problem-solving, and communication. In other words, **I may never be the best developer** on the team.

## My vision

I believe work is **more than earning a salary**. It's about contributing to society, helping communities with their problems and helping them grow. As Rosalía says, "craft and mastery":

I think good products can change our lives, and I would be proud to help build revolutionary products.

Lastly, one of my favorite TV commercials that summarizes my worldview quite well:
