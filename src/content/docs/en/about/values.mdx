description: The fundamental principles that guide my decisions and shape my work in software engineering.

### What gets me pumped

- **Product is the key**. If I am not 100% aligned with the product I feel I am not contributing to society. I would like to work in products that I can be proud of.
- **Multidisciplinary** environment, where, despite each of us having our own strengths, we can share our opinions on different areas such as design or business.
- I appreciate when the engineering team has **direct interaction with users and the business**, without impenetrable intermediaries like Product Owners or Product Managers.
- I enjoy **bootstrapping projects**, applying the Pareto principle to quickly achieve 80% of the results with 20% of the effort.
- **Quality is a must**. It’s not enough to just solve a problem; the solution must be scalable and understandable by other team members.

### What gets me disappointed

- No hierarchies and **unnecessary bureaucracy**, this overwhelm me.
- Over-engineering, spending more time on implementation than on solving the actual problem, and **teams that prioritize technical solutions over functional** ones are things I try to avoid.

### Strengths

- I excel at **understanding the business and its key pain points**, translating them into solutions that address real problems.
- I’m skilled at **translating business language into code**, making it more maintainable and scalable. *If someone from the business side understood programming, they should be able to understand our code*.

### Improvement points

- Due to my multidisciplinary approach, I haven't dedicated 100% of my time to becoming the best technically. Instead, I've chosen to also focus on areas like design, product, complex problem-solving, and communication. As a result, **I may never be the top developer** on the team.

## My vision

I believe that work is **more than just earning a wage**. It's about contributing to society, helping others with their problems, and personal growth. Work is about building a craft and doing things with mastery, as Rosalía says (*sorry, it’s in Spanish*):

I think that good products can change our lives, so I would like to help build game-changing products that I can be proud of. 

Exponential Fellowship can help me get closer to those companies dealing with the early stages of their product, and learn to craft software in highly uncertain environments. I love Spain, and although the startup sector is gaining more relevance every day, I believe it needs a little push to compete and reach the level of other countries like the United States. **I would love to contribute to making this country start exporting digital products and services** that the entire nation can be proud of.

*Lastly, one of my favorite TV ads that summarizes my worldview quite well*
